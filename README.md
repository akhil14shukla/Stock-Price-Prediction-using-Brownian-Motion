Stock Price Prediction

Disclaimer:
Do not use our model directly to buy or sell stocks in real life, we do not guarantee any success.

We will use Geometric Brownian Motion to predict the sotck price.

Theorey behind the model includes knowledge of Stochastic processes, Brownian Motion, Ito's Theorem, Geometric Brownian Motion and basics of stochastic differential equations.
To build the model and writing the code, knowledge of Python and knowledge of following libraries is required: pandas, numpy and matlplotlib.

First, we
